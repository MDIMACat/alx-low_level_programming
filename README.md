This repository is based on the low level programming language known as C.

The C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie in collaboration with Ken Thompson at the Bell laboratries in 1972. C programming language was derived from the B programming language. C programming language was used to write the Unix operating system.

With that brief history we can now get into the purpose of this repository. That purpose being a series of tasks provided by ALX SE Program to intergrate students into understanding the low level language C.

These tasks will be executed in designated directories which will be listed in this file

these directories being:
	1. 0x00 C-Hello, World
